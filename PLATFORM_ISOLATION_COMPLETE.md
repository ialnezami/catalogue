# Platform Isolation - Complete Implementation

## Summary
Each admin now only has access to their own platform's products and orders. Platform is automatically detected from the admin's session cookie.

## How It Works

### 1. Admin Login
- When an admin logs in, their platform is stored in `admin_platform` cookie
- Example: Admin for "test1" platform gets `admin_platform=test1` cookie

### 2. Platform Detection Priority
The `getPlatformFromRequest` function checks in this order:
1. **Admin Cookie** (Highest Priority) - `admin_platform` cookie value
2. URL Parameter - `?platform=X` (for public pages)
3. Subdomain - `shop.domain.com`
4. Default - Falls back to `'default'`

### 3. API Routes
All API routes automatically filter by platform:
- `/api/products` - Only returns products for admin's platform
- `/api/products/[id]` - Only allows access to products from admin's platform
- `/api/orders` - Only returns orders for admin's platform
- `/api/settings` - Only returns settings for admin's platform

### 4. Admin Pages
- **Admin Products** (`/admin/products`)
  - Gets platform from `/api/auth/check` on mount
  - API calls automatically use admin's platform from cookie
  - Admin can only see/edit products for their platform

- **Admin Orders** (`/admin/orders`)
  - Fetches orders from `/api/orders`
  - API automatically filters by admin's platform
  - Admin only sees orders for their platform

- **POS** (`/pos`)
  - Products loaded automatically use admin's platform
  - Orders saved automatically tagged with admin's platform

## Security Features

1. **Automatic Filtering**: All database queries automatically include platform filter
2. **Cookie-Based**: Platform comes from secure HttpOnly cookie
3. **No Manual Override**: Admins cannot access other platforms by changing URL
4. **Session-Based**: Platform is tied to login session

## Testing

### Test Admin Isolation:
1. Create admin for platform "test1"
2. Create admin for platform "test2"
3. Login as test1 admin
   - Should only see test1 products
   - Should only see test1 orders
4. Login as test2 admin
   - Should only see test2 products
   - Should only see test2 orders

### Test URL Parameters:
- Public pages still use URL parameters: `/?platform=test1`
- Admin pages ignore URL parameters, use session platform instead

## Files Modified

1. **lib/platform.ts** - Updated to check `admin_platform` cookie first
2. **pages/admin/products.tsx** - Uses platform from auth session
3. **pages/api/products/index.ts** - Already uses platform detection
4. **pages/api/orders/index.ts** - Already uses platform detection
5. **pages/api/auth/login.ts** - Sets `admin_platform` cookie
6. **pages/api/auth/check.ts** - Returns `adminPlatform` from cookie

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Isolation**: Each admin can only access their platform
✅ **Automatic**: No need to pass platform in API calls
✅ **Secure**: Platform comes from authenticated session
✅ **Transparent**: Works seamlessly without admin knowing
